# FaceIT Stats Compiler
 A Python script that is able to compile the statistics of all players from a certain amount of recent matches from a FaceIT Hub. This data is then uploaded into an easy to read Google spreadsheet.
 
 'ScriptV3' is the final version of the main hub statisics script
 
 'indiv' is a work in progress script for pulling the stats for a specific player from a specific amount of matches from a specific hub.
 e.g. My last stats in my last 50 games in the UKCL Hub.
